At first he feared he'd gone mad from too many late nights of experiments and accidentally-inhaled chemical fumes, but the voice assured him that it was no mere figment of the imagination. In fact, the voice had a proposition for him: if Wilson would build a machine according to their specifications, then he would be rewarded with secret knowledge, the likes of which no one had ever seen. Casting aside his better judgement (after all, what harm could come from making a vague bargain with a mysterious disembodied voice?) Wilson threw himself into constructing the machine. When at long last it was finally completed, the gentleman scientist had a moment of hesitation... a moment that might have saved him from his impending fate, had he been just a bit stronger of will.

But when Bernie was taken away as punishment for what her caregivers saw as unfit behavior, Willow was left to fend for herself when the shadows came for her. That's when she learned that nothing holds back the darkness like a roaring flame. Nothing is more comforting than watching your troubles light up and crumble to ash...\nIt wouldn't be the last time Willow burned it all down to start anew." },

Using every bit of knowledge he'd gained from his time in the Constant (and some additional tips from Ms. Wickerbottom) he soon discovered that his transformations could in fact be controlled.

Wolfgang quickly found himself caught up in the pageantry of circus life, and his attention began to shift to finding ways to make his show more spectacular. Fearing his own strength wouldn't be enough to keep impressing the crowds, he started employing a bit of stage trickery, with each new act becoming more unbelievable than the last. As his act grew more outlandish, the risk of being exposed as a fraud grew, and as he suffered one embarrassing mistake after another his once unshakable confidence in his abilities was slowly chipped away.\nUntil one day, a chance encounter gave him a taste of the ultimate strength he had craved for so long..." },

Casting off his old, meek ways and fully embracing his new persona as a charismatic master of dark magic, Maxwell achieved fame and success, but still found himself hungering for more. As he delved deeper and deeper into his magical tome, immersing himself in its secrets, the dark knowledge within addled his mind and clouded his heart. In his final performance, Maxwell lost control of the shadow magic he'd used so brazenly and both he and his stage assistant Charlie were pulled into the Constant. There he would remain for what seemed like an eternity, tethered to the Nightmare Throne and compelled to ensnare more victims in the Constant's trap.\nHe is still baffled by the thought that someone he tricked into the Constant could find it in their heart to set him free... well, baffled and annoyed really.

For over a decade she tracked down every clue, followed every lead, poked, prodded, and questioned anyone who might have a connection to the case, until all the loose strings started to come together. There was a radio factory, founded by a peculiar old man whose genius was only matched by his secretiveness, that might hold the answers she had sought for so long. Shortly after securing employment at the factory, the building was destroyed in an accident caused by a malfunctioning portal. Having caught sight of someone getting caught in the portal and vanishing, Winona hastily repaired it in the hopes of rescuing them, only to come face to face with her missing sister. Unfortunately, Charlie seemed to be held under the sway of a shadowy influence, and she dragged Winona into the Constant." },
